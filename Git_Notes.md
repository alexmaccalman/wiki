`git status`

stage the commit, period means all files otherwise, put the file name we want to commit.
`git add .`

then commit with a commit message, also could add andother -m for a description
`git commit -m"added index.html"`  
then push to remote repo, origin stands for the location of the git repo
`git push origin master`  

to create repo on github from local folder use this
